
This NAnt scripts don´t work (for now) for the .NET 2.0 Solution.

Only works in the .NET 1.1 framework.

The problem is that .Net Solutions of the VS2005 don't are
supported by solutions task of NAnt in the version 0.85rc3.

I know that if use directly the csc task this problem is solved 
but I don´t have time to do this every time that I add a file to
the solution and test it, then if somebody want to do so are welcome !!!

Cheers
